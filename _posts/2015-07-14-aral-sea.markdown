During the last 60 years [Aral Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea) has almost completely dryed up. This shrinking is considered to be "one of the planet's worst environmental disasters".

I took the surface outlines of Aral Sea [from past 60 years](http://www.unep.org/dewa/vitalwater/article115.html) and combined them together into a single 3D paper cube:
